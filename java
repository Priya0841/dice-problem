class Solution{
    static int oppositeFaceOfDice(int N){
        
        return 7 - N ; 
    }
}

Explanation:

We know that the sum of opposite faces on a standard six-faced dice is always 7.
So, to find the number on the opposite face, we subtract the given number from 7. This gives us the number on the opposite face.
For example:

If the given number is 6, then the opposite face will be 
7 − 6 = 1.
If the given number is 2, then the opposite face will be 
7 − 2 = 5.
